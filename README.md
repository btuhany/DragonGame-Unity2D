This my second project on Unity. It's a basic flappy bird clonish game with launching projectile mechanics and enemies. <br>
I finish this project while studying an udemy course and also added new mechanics and changed a lot of things. <br>
You can find the similar sample project on the udemy course "Unity 2D Temel C# ve Doğru Kodlama Eğitimi - Berk Terek".  <br> 
<br>
Apart from the sample project i added:
- New enemy that can launch projectile like the player in a random time and its spawner.
- Enemy death particles
- Different sounds that differences with the enemy type
- Scrolling background
- Fewer spawners that randomly generates the spawn position
- Added tree obstacle spawner also to the top thus, i think the game had been much better
- Different scores from killing different enemies
- Getting score while keep going without any need to kill enemies
- Different background, different background boundaries, different menu and gameover canvas
